LifeStream - Instant Photo Sharing
Copyright (C) 2014 Kayateia

Please see the GPLv3 under notes for license info.

-----

Setting up your own LifeStream instance:

- Provide a debug signing key.
- Edit the sources and replace things in <>. Specifically the GCM IDs and
  stuff in Settings.java.
- Edit config.php in the server code to put in your GCM app key and other
  such things.
- Create the database using schema.sql.
- You need a PHP server that has Curl support.
- You have to set up the photo paths on the server writable by the web
  server, and you have to insert user info manually right now. Passwords
  are SHA hashed.
- If you want to use a private self-signed SSL key, look in utils to build
  a custom keystore (and enable it in the code).

Eventually I would like to make these things more graceful so that one
copy of the app is able to connect to different people's servers.
